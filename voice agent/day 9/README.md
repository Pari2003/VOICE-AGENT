## 🛠 Technical Innovation

### Enhanced `/llm/query` Endpoint

The endpoint now accepts **both text and audio input**:

**Text Input (Original):**

```json
POST /llm/query
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "query": "What is machine learning?",
  "max_tokens": 1000,
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

**Audio Input (NEW):**

```form-data
POST /llm/query
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- file: audio_file.webm
- voice_id: "en-US-natalie"
- max_tokens: 800
- temperature: 0.7
```

### Smart Text Chunking

- **Problem**: Murf API has 3000 character limit
- **Solution**: Intelligent text splitting at sentence boundaries
- **Result**: Long AI responses are split and played sequentially

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Voice-to-voice LLM conversation completed successfully",
  "query": "Your transcribed question",
  "response": "AI generated response text",
  "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
  "voice_id": "en-US-natalie",
  "audio_url": "single_audio_url", // for short responses
  "audio_urls": ["url1", "url2"], // for chunked responses
  "is_chunked": false,
  "chunk_count": 1,
  "response_length": 245,
  "word_count": 42,
  "generated_at": "2025-08-10T..."
}
```
